## Capstone project introduction

This application has been created as the result of the capstone project for Data Science Specialization on Coursera.

The main goal of this project is to create a predictive text shiny application, similar to the ones you find in your mobile phones, that given a sentence, will try to predict what might be the next word.

## Data Clean and manipulation description

Initial data set consist of hundreds of MB of text, thousands of sentences, millions of words.
Due to the sheer size of the data, it had to be transformed and reduced to a manageable size, to allow an application to use it efficiently and with a good speed.

The idea is that an application like this should be able to run on a mobile device, that has reduced memory and CPU power, therefore it has been manipulated to create a series of entities that are faster and efficient to analyze.

## How to use the application
The app emulates a mobile chat screen, where you have:

- First field shows the complete sentence for your input text plus the first predicted word

- Second field shows the 3 words that are most related to the input text

- In the third field you can input your text and see the result, it is initialized with an example

If you insert a new text, for example "Life is like a", you will get "**BOX**" as suggested first word and "Life is like a box" as suggested sentence.
